Please update the application with the following changes. Remove the option in the sidebar that lets users choose what tiles are draggable, as it is not needed. In the Vendors section, remove the “All Vendors” subsection since clicking on Vendors already shows all vendors. On the Reports page, fix the layout so that the report content does not overlap with the sidebar. For the Global Search, when I search (e.g., “MacBook”), it should open a dedicated search results page listing all matching rows from the database, and when I click on a specific item in the results, only the details for that row should be shown.

In asset creation, all assets except software should have warranty and expiration fields; software should instead have a renewal date, and this renewal date should be used in the “Expiring Warranties & Licenses (Next 30 Days)” section. For Asset Age Analysis, show all assets (excluding software) purchased more than 3 years ago based on their purchase date. The + button still has issues: while vendors correctly open the vendor creation form, assets and user accounts are still going to their listing pages instead of the creation form, so please fix this. The AI Assistant icon is missing from the view—bring it back. Also, remove the unnecessary “Compliance Risk” section from the dashboard. Swap the positions of the description and the global search bar in the top bar.

For location, replace manual location entry with predefined fields (Country, State, City) that tie into the map being used. The system should use these values to map assets properly (e.g., India → Tamil Nadu → Chennai), and counts should update automatically when new assets are added. Move the Activity Logs section into the Reports page and remove it from the sidebar.

Fix the draggable functionality so that tiles are independent, not grouped. For example, in the dashboard asset counts, each tile (like Hardware count) should be draggable individually, not as one grouped block. Finally, fix the overlay issue with the + button: when clicked, the background of the options menu should be opaque instead of transparent so that the options can be read clearly.
