I will recreate the requirements document for the IT Asset Management (IT AM) SaaS application, now specifically tailored for the **MEAN Stack** and incorporating the **LLM-based analysis** functionality. This document can be used as a detailed guide for an AI coding assistant.

### 1.0 Executive Summary

This document serves as a detailed guide for building an **IT Asset Management (IT AM) SaaS application** using the **MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js)**. The application will be a multi-tenant platform for managing IT assets, including hardware, software, and peripherals, throughout their entire lifecycle. A key feature is the integration of an external **Large Language Model (LLM) API** to provide intelligent analysis of asset utilization and to generate actionable recommendations for optimization.

### 2.0 Functional Requirements

#### 2.1 Asset Lifecycle Management
The application must support comprehensive management of IT assets from procurement to disposal.

* **Asset Catalog:** A central repository to store detailed information for each asset. The data model should be flexible to accommodate different asset types.
* **Asset Creation:**
    * **Manual Entry:** Users must be able to add a new asset record via a form in the Angular frontend.
    * **Bulk Import:** The system must support importing assets from a CSV file.
    * **Automated Discovery:** The application needs a component to scan the network (using agent-based or agentless methods) and automatically populate asset data, including hardware specifications, IP/MAC addresses, and installed software.
* **Asset Updates:** Users should be able to update asset details, location, assigned user, and status.
* **Lifecycle Status:** The system must track an asset's status through its lifecycle (**In Stock, Deployed, In Repair, Disposed**).

#### 2.2 Software Asset Management (SAM)
The system must provide tools for tracking and managing software licenses.

* **License Tracking:** The application must track the number of purchased licenses versus the number of installations to ensure **license compliance**.
* **Reclamation:** The system should identify unused software and allow for license reclamation.
* **Compliance Dashboard:** A dedicated dashboard will display a compliance overview, flagging any over- or under-licensed software.

#### 2.3 LLM-Powered Recommendations
The application will use an LLM API to analyze asset data and provide optimization suggestions.

* **Data Collection:** The Node.js backend will collect and store utilization data from assets, including **CPU, RAM, disk usage, and software usage time**.
* **LLM Integration:** An Express.js service will be created to communicate with the LLM API. This service will prepare and send structured data to the LLM.
* **Analysis Prompts:** The LLM will be prompted to analyze the data to provide suggestions:
    * **Underutilization:** Suggest a **downgrade** for assets with consistently low utilization or **release** licenses for unused software.
    * **Overutilization:** Suggest an **upgrade** for assets with consistently high utilization to prevent performance issues.
    * **Efficiency Suggestions:** Identify patterns to suggest asset consolidation or re-allocation.
* **User Interface:** The Angular frontend must have a dedicated "Recommendations" section to display the LLM's suggestions in a clear, actionable format. Users should be able to accept or dismiss these suggestions.

### 3.0 Non-Functional Requirements

#### 3.1 Architecture and Technology Stack
* **Frontend (Angular):** The user interface will be built with Angular to create a responsive, single-page application.
* **Backend (Express.js & Node.js):** The backend will be a RESTful API built on Express.js and Node.js. It will handle all business logic, data validation, and API integrations.
* **Database (MongoDB):** MongoDB will be used as the primary database due to its flexibility with schemaless data, which is ideal for varying asset attributes. The database must be configured for multi-tenancy to ensure data isolation.

#### 3.2 Security
* **Authentication and Authorization:**
    * Implement **secure user authentication** (sign-up, login, password management).
    * Use **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for session management.
    * Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to restrict user permissions (e.g., Admin, IT Manager, Read-Only).
* **Data Encryption:** All data must be **encrypted at rest (in the MongoDB database)** and **in transit (using TLS/SSL)** between the frontend and backend.
* **Tenant Isolation:** The database schema must be designed to logically separate each client's data to prevent cross-tenant access.

#### 3.3 User Experience (UX)
* **Intuitive UI:** The Angular UI should be clean, modern, and easy to navigate.
* **Dashboard:** A customizable dashboard will provide a high-level overview of key metrics such as total assets, compliance status, and upcoming warranty expirations.
* **Reporting:** The application will generate comprehensive reports on assets, software, and costs, with export options to **CSV and PDF**.
* **Search and Filters:** Powerful search and filtering capabilities are essential for finding specific assets quickly.

#### 3.4 Integration and Scalability
* **API:** A well-documented **RESTful API** will be a core feature, allowing for integration with other business systems like ticketing tools or CMDBs.
* **Scalability:** The architecture must be scalable to handle thousands of assets and a growing number of users. The Node.js and MongoDB combination is well-suited for horizontal scaling.
